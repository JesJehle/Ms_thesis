The value of remotely-sensed data as a source of input data for environmental processes modelling has been increasing in the past years (\cite{melesse2007remote})

Through contributions of several earth observation missions, the stock of freely available remote sensing data, as well as its temporal and spatial resolution, is continuously growing (\cite{melesse2007remote}).


The value of remotely-sensed data as a source of input data for environmental processes modelling has been increasing in the past years (Assefa M. Melesse). The increasing availability of remotely-sensed data from different sensors with a wide range of spatial and temporal resolution and radiometric has made remote sensing data, perhaps, the best source of data for large-scale applications and study
