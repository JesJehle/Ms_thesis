In this master's thesis a R package that enables an interface between R and EE to retrieve selected data sets for a given region and time of interest, was successfully developed. The simplified access to the capabilities of EE provided by the earthEngineGrabR packages showed potential to strongly simplify the remote sensing data acquisition process. Compared to the standard approach to download and preprocess remote sensing data on a local system, the use of the earthEngineGrabR provided significant savings of time and computational resources in several cases. 

However, the current version of the package still presents only a basis. To be used in wide scientific context a further development and the implementation of additional features is necessary. 
The number of available data products and corresponding properties need to be extended.
Further, the implemented integration of R and Python is still error-prone and leads to operating system interoperability.  
Most of the limitations can be rectified with a further development of the package such as implementing additional features and improving the integration between R and Python.

Still, there are internal limitations of EE that restrict the possibility of the earthEngineGrabR. Altough EE can perform expensive computations, the download of large remote sensing datasets is inefficient, due to the export limit of EE to Google Drive. 
While the data that can be processed inside EE can become remarkably large, the data that can be exported is proportionally small.

This implies, instead of allowing the export of big geospatial data the earthEngineGrabR provides the processing of big geospatial data and the acquisition of the results.

To use the full potential of EE, the earthEngineGrabR has to provide comfortable and user-friendly access to the capabilities of EE to generate a variety of processing intensive data products and retrieve them in a strongly user defined format.
